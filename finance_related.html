	<p dir="ltr"><span><b>BITS PILANI - Finance-related Information</b></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>DISCLAIMER</span><span> - This was written by students of BITS Pilani University and in no scenario should be considered as </span><span>&ldquo;Official&rdquo;</span><span>. This is merely to guide the students and everyone is expected to do their own research before they make any decisions.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This is in response to the frequently occurring expenditure and finance related matters for education at BITS Pilani.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The Fee structure for academic year 2015-16 is given below:-</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<img src="img/feetable.png" />
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Points to be noted:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>1) The fees given is for academic year 2015-16.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>2) The institute reserves right to increase semester fees every year but not beyond 15%. Please see that it is not compulsory that institute will increase it every year.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>3)</span><span> All fees are to be paid in advance. Only caution deposit and mess advance is refundable after adjustment of dues at the time of withdrawal from the Institute.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Regarding other expenses:-</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>1) &nbsp;Apart from the semester fees you will also have expenses in the name of MESS BILL.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Mess Bill is for the food you are provided in your hostel mess, electricity in your room and ranges from 3.5k-6k per month depending on extra food items like Chips, Biscuits, Ice-cream, Non-Veg, Fruits, Milk, Custard, and omelette taken by you apart from the food provided according to the predetermined Menu. Ice-creams, fruits and omelette are generally provided in menu every week on a fixed day but if you want to purchase when it is not in the menu, you have to pay extra charges. Apart from this you also buy Bits merchandise (tshirts, hoodies etc.), sign for workshops etc.; cost of all this is deducted from your mess bill.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In general estimate of 3.5k to 6k for mess bill can be considered per month after everything.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The advance mess deposit taken per semester is adjusted in your mess charges.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>So you can have a rough estimate for your semester mess bill (1 semester=approximately 4 months) charges.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>2) &nbsp;Miscellaneous expenses-</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Daily requirement items, eating at other food joints other than mess etc.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Varies from student to student, as per their need and requirement.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Thus, including everything, BITS may approximately cost you 2.8-3 lakhs per annum.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>(The following will have figures from the Pilani Campus. These are not the stats for Goa/Hyd)</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Scholarships:-</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>1) Merit Scholarship (awarded each semester):-</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>80% reimbursement of semester fees for 1% and 40% of semester fees for 2% students.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This year for 2014 batch CGPA cut off for 80 % (INR 71,600) scholarship was 9.82 and 40% (INR 35,800) was 9.59.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Everyone is eligible for this.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>2) Merit cum need Scholarship (awarded each semester):-</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>3% students will receive the reimbursement of 80%, 6% students will get 40% and 12% students will &nbsp;get 25% of their semester fees under merit-cum-need awards.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Students whose parental income is less than 5.5 lakhs are eligible for this. The amount of scholarship changes as per semester fees.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>3) Other BITSAA Scholarships</span><span> for which amount varies and you have to apply separately. Details on how to apply will be provided on campus. Their amount and eligibility varies.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>4) INSPIRE</span><span> Scholarship-For MSc. Students (except Economics) satisfying the criteria on the website for INSPIRE scholarship are given 80,000 INR scholarship per semester.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Loan Options:-</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Most of the banks have a special educational loan scheme termed </span><span>Scholar&rsquo;s Loan </span><span>for students getting admission in Premier educational institutes. BITS Pilani (all the campuses) are part of these schemes of all the major banks.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><br class="kix-line-break" /></span><span>Scholar&rsquo;s Loan can be availed from the SBI Branch </span><span>on-campus </span><span>(all three campuses have a SBI Branch). </span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Advantage of a Scholar Loan over Education Loan are :</span><span><br class="kix-line-break" /></span><span>1. Lower interest rates.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>2. 100% fee coverage.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>3. No collateral.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>NOTE: </span><span>If you try for a scholar loan in any other branch (for example, a branch in your hometown), they might have different fee coverage (about 80% to 90%) and might take collateral (although the interest rates will always be lesser than an education loan).</span><span><br class="kix-line-break" /></span><span> &nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Hope this answers your doubts regarding finances for education in BITS PILANI.</span></p>
