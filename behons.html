<p><strong>B.E. (Hons) Chemical Engineering</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Sincere thanks to Manas Luthra (2014 Batch, Pilani) for his contribution.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q. How is the branch? What are its positive and negative sides?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ans. If you are really interested in chemical engineering then you will never regret taking it. But if you take it out of some compulsion then you might end up feeling that you could have taken some other branch or maybe some MSc. But this is not always the case. Once you start studying the subjects you will find them great and indulging. Plus chemical engineering being a diverse field, you can end up having job in almost any sector of life. There are excellent pay and benefits and intellectually stimulating work. But depending on your job, sometimes there are potentially hazardous working conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q. What you will learn, and what are the nearest JEE topics to them?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ans. These subjects most aspirants must have studied while preparing for jee. You will study these again in much more depth and many more such subjects. They include Fluid mechanics, Thermodynamics, Heat Transfer and Kinetics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will learn the following key concepts : Chemical reaction engineering, Plant design, Process design, Transport phenomena.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q. What is the scope of the branch in future?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ans. Placements are possible in many of the top companies like EIL , Shell , Schlumberger, IOCL, RIL and many more. There are vast job opportunities and you can take up jobs in research work, become a professor or work in big MNCs. Chemical engineering has vast applications in all spheres of life. And so you can take up jobs related to biotechnology, nanotechnology, mineral processing and many more fields.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>B.E. (Hons) Civil Engineering</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Sincere thanks to Subham Thakur (2014 Batch, Pilani), Reeti Sarkar (2013 Batch, Hyderabad) and Hridyesh Tewani (2013 Batch, Hyderabad) for their contribution.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q. How is the branch? What are its positive and negative sides?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ans. Civil Engineering is considered as the mother of engineering. It has various things to explore. There is even nice scope for placement in foreign countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Positive Side: Civil is a core branch &nbsp;which means the branch has a lot of scope in future, like you can get into R&amp;D or you can continue in the constructor sector etc. Most subjects start from scratch, which makes them easy to learn. Additionally, number of hours is low and grading is pretty fair: on the whole, it's probably one of the easiest-to-cope-with branches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Negative Side: As I already mentioned that it's a core branch which also means the initial pay will be less as compared to other core branches but it will increase exponentially if you continue in this branch. Faculty is also mixed - don't expect equally good teachers in every subject. Also, research in Hyderabad is primarily on water resources. As of 2014-15 session, the structures faculty was also stretched a little thin. But there is talk of new faculty from next session so do some homework on both faculty and research projects for next session by yourself before deciding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q. What you will learn, and what are the nearest JEE topics to them?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ans. Mechanics, Fluid Mechanics, Kinematics, Forces and Free Body Diagrams</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q. What are good dual options and why?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ans. MSc Physics/Economics/Biology +B.E (Hons) Civil might be a good combination</p>
<p>There are not too many common courses but those who are interested in multidisciplinary research Biology or Physics+Civil is a good option</p>
<p>Economics, if you are interested in costing, scheduling, Optimization of the cost, etc. It is good dual.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q. What is the scope of the branch in future?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ans. Generally people who take civil try for some IT companies and they get placed also but this is not the judicial way.</p>
<p>Students who sit for civil placements (L&amp;T s the main dream company for civil, don't get excited it gives you a job offer of 5.1 lakhs pa), generally study for further study in Civil.</p>
<p>Some of the scopes are mentioned below: Designing, Construction, Planning, Analysis etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div align="center"><hr align="center" size="2" width="100%" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>B.E. (Hons) Electronics and Communication</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Sincere thanks to Saumya Kumar Saksena (2013 Batch, Hyderabad) and Gautam Thakur (2013 Batch, Hyderabad) for their contribution.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q. How is the branch? What are its positive and negative sides?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ans. The only branch apart from EEE, that has fingers in electrical electronics, telecommunications and computer science. A post graduation opportunity is open in various fields like embedded systems, artificial intelligence etc. EC engineers can pursue a Master's degree in CS, EEE or telecom as they wish.</p>
<p>Speciality of this branch lies in the wide future scope it offers for future specialisations, in Electronics, Communications, as well as Computers field.</p>
<p>Experienced approachable faculty who encourage Concept-building apart from mere covering of the course is an additional advantage of joining the branch.</p>
<p>A negative aspect lies in the slightly increased workload as compared to other branches, though which is highly manageable with some regularity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q. What you will learn, and what are the nearest JEE topics to them?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ans. Topics related to communications(analog and digital, image processing), basic electrical engineering(about transformers, motors, basic electric circuits), electronic engineering(semiconductors, BJT,MOSfets, Amplifiers), hardware knowledge of Computer Science field (MicroProcessor basics, Digital Design and some more elective courses), Electronic Devices, Micro-Electronics Circuits, Analog and Digital VLSI Design*, Analog Electronics, EM Waves &amp; Microwave Engineering, Microprocessors, Computer Architecture*, Information Theory and Coding, Modern Communication Technologies, Communication Networks, Fundamentals of Electromagnetism, Digital Electronics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*-Discipline Electives</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JEE related - Mostly physics related-- Electrostatics, Alternating Current, Semiconductors, ElectroDynamics, ElectroMagnetic Theory, Electrical Machines(theory of Motors and Transformers)--with an obvious use of Math Calculus concepts and Trigonometry wherever needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q. What are good dual options and why?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maths + EEE/ECE/ENI = Decent combination, the knowledge of optimization, helps electronics students understand the mathematical aspects of the circuits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bio + Any BE = Is a good combination. Since it is a life science subject, almost all branches connect to it someway or the other, like human computer interfacing technology, or medical instrumentation, or bio chemistry, or bio physics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phy + Any BE = Since all the engineering comes from physics itself, so it kind of merges with all the BE's without any hesitation. Like computational physics is phy + cs, which is pretty much in demand then phy + ECE/EEE/ENI is the best for physics, because the mentioned BE's are completely derived from physics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q. What is the scope of the branch in future?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An EC engineer can not only apply for Indian engg services, but are also in demand by various reputed organizations of the world like CERN, NASA, ISRO etc. Even Facebook hires only telecom engineers from IIT KGP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Job in Communication related Companies (eg. Samsung, Reliance, Ericsson, QualComm)</p>
<p>Job in Electronics related Companies (eg. Texas instruments)</p>
<p>Higher studies in ECE or diversification into Computers field with a study of software and thus increased future prospects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some other companies are: BSNL, Airtel (All the telecom companies basically), DRDO, ISRO, NASA, CERN</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Job opportunities also include satellite, avionics, mobile, antenna, radio and radar engineers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ans. Physics+EEE, Learning more about semiconductors can take you closer to electronic/electrical devices and gives you an edge.</p>
<p>Math+EEE A lot of math goes into EEE, so having a Math dual can give you an edge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q. What is the scope of the branch in future?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ans. Some of the companies that participate in campus placements: Texas instruments, Tejas networks, Siemens, Epic systems, nVidia, Intel, Qualcomm, Broadcomm, Freescale, Nokia, Samsung, Ericsson RnD and so on, the list is long.</p>
<div align="center"><hr align="center" size="2" width="100%" /></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Sincere thanks to Harsh Nijhawan (2014 Batch, Pilani) and Vamsi YS (2013 Batch, Goa) for their contribution.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q. How is the branch? What are its positive and negative sides?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ans. The branch is quite interesting though people say it is the toughest branch and curriculum. But it is a core branch having a great scope for research and equivalent job opportunities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Great scope</li>
<li>Has multiple courses similar to EEE and can take the courses which are different in the form of electives</li>
<li>If you are enthusiastic about the subject, you will find the courses very interesting</li>
<li>Course structure is closely in synchronisation with the industry</li>
</ol>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Heaviest course structure</li>
<li>Faculty may not be very good</li>
<li>If you want to switch your field once you do enter, you&rsquo;ll have to work extra hard.</li>
</ol>
<p>Suggestions:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Do not rely on your professors to teach you something. Download lecture videos from DC and watch them. You&rsquo;ll learn more from them.</li>
<li>Pay attention to all the three math courses (M1, M2, and M3). They&rsquo;ll be used in great depth in various courses.</li>
<li>Never miss a lecture of some professors (get the list from your seniors)</li>
<li>If there is a quiz component in the course, attend the class even if you think that it is only a rumour about quiz. Quizzes will play a major role in deciding your total score at semester end.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Sincere thanks to Shubham Shukla (2014 Batch, Pilani) for his contribution.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q. How is the branch? What are its positive and negative sides?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ans. Positive:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amazing faculty; well maintained labs; co operative seniors; active technical association; favourable growth conditions because of Govt. Of India&rsquo;s Make in India initiative</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Negatives:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tendency to undermine the stream; not an active alumni base</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q. What you will learn, and what are the nearest JEE topics to them?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ans. Thermodynamics; mechanics and differential equations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q. What are good dual options and why?</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>B.E. (Hons) Mechanical Engineering</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Sincere thanks to Vishwesh Ravi Shrimali (2014 Batch, Pilani) for his contribution.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q. How is the branch? What are its positive and negative sides?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ans. Mechanical Engineering is a really interesting branch if you are fascinated by machines and their working principles. If you are a car enthusiast you are a perfect candidate for Mechanical Engineering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Positives:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mechanical engineers get beneficial aspects like being provided with medical, dental, and vision coverage. Most companies who hire starting engineers get 2 weeks of paid vacation. Also, a Mechanical engineers' retirement account has a $401,000 plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Negatives:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mechanical engineers need to be very smart. Lots of math and science are involved in college if you are choosing to become a Mechanical engineer. They also need very good communication skills. Traveling between sites are also involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q. What you will learn, and what are the nearest JEE topics to them?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ans. Fluid mechanics, Dynamics</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q. What are good dual options and why?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ans. MSc Physics + B.E. Mech is the most preferred option as you will feel more comfortable learning Mechanical courses as you will learn a lot similar to it in MSc Physics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other than this, all other M.Sc. courses will also suit Mechanical very well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q. What is the scope of the branch in future?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ans. A large number of companies participate in campus placements. You can find the list here: <a href="http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/uploads/Pilani_Upload/Mech.pdf">http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/uploads/Pilani_Upload/Mech.pdf</a> (for Pilani Campus).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though, Mechanical may not have an attractive starting salary, after 4 - 5 years it finally results in a fancy salary.</p>
<p>But, choose Mechanical only if you are interested in it, otherwise it can bring some pains to you as well.</p>

<p><strong>B.Pharm</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Sincere thanks to V Santosh (2012 Batch, Hyderabad) and Asmitha Vanaparthi (2012 Batch, Hyderabad) for their contribution.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q. How is the branch? What are its positive and negative sides?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ans. The course is quite good. But the main drawback is that the chances of getting a good job right after B.Pharm (in the discipline itself) would be difficult. At least M.Pharm will have to be completed.</p>
<p>There are a lot of lab related courses and these will have compulsory attendance, as opposed to all the other courses.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>1.Very practical.</p>
<p>2.Being a life science, if you are able to appreciate the subject, you'll love it.</p>
<p>3.Lots of scope for research.</p>
<p>4. BITS is one among the best places to do Bpharm and I think it's one among the few places where a particular branch of pharma;related to jurisdiction is dealt with a lot of insight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>1.Very slight chances of getting placed immediately after final year. Even if placed, payroll is very less for a graduate.</p>
<p>2. Course is laden with labs. A lot.</p>
<p>3. Have to deal with a bit of Bio, chem. (I can't actually put it into 'cons'. It depends on the person)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q. What you will learn, and what are the nearest JEE topics to them?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ans.</p>
<p>1. Medicinal chemistry- needs very basics of Organic chemistry. Most of it will be covered here though.</p>
<p>2. Pharmaceutics: I don't think it's related to any of the courses covered in the preparation for IIT. It's full of logic.</p>
<p>3. Pharmacology: kind of like Biology.</p>
<p>4. Microbiology: the name says it all. Micro organisms and all.</p>
<p>5. Forensic pharmacy: deals with jurisdiction, industrial laws and norms, FDA regulations etc. very cool stuff. :p</p>
<p>6.pharmaceutical Analysis: basics of chemistry like Chromatography, titration techniques etc.</p>
<p>7. Physical pharmacy: kind of like physical chemistry.</p>
<p>8. Biochemistry</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q. What is the scope of the branch in future?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ans. It's possible to get jobs related to analysis in the field, but there probably aren't a lot of opportunities to improve the career with just B. Pharm. Finishing M.Pharm and preferably a PhD can get good jobs, even abroad.</p>
