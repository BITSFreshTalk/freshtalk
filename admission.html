	<p><strong>ADMISSION PROCESS - GENERAL</strong></p>
<p><strong>What are the various rounds of Counselling in BITS? Where are they held?</strong></p>
<p>Counselling in BITS is done completely online. You fill your own choice of preferences, called the</p>
<p>Preference Order and then you&rsquo;re allotted seats in various rounds called &ldquo;Iterations&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>How do I fill the Preference Order?</strong></p>
<p>Go to http://www.bitsadmission.com/fdmain.aspx and follow the instructions</p>
<p><strong>How many times do I have to fill the preference Order?</strong></p>
<p>Admissions to all three Indian BITS campuses (Pilani, Goa and Hyderabad) is through the same</p>
<p>list so just fill your preferences for all campuses.</p>
<p>However, if you are interested in B. Pharma, it has a different list than other integrated first</p>
<p>degree admissions. Check out http://www.bitsadmission.com/fdmain.aspx for more information.</p>
<p><strong>When can I fill the Preference Order until?</strong></p>
<p>The last date for applying and filling the order is 30th June (at 5 pm). There is no &ldquo;First Come</p>
<p>First Serve&rdquo; here so weigh all the options and make your choices carefully before applying.</p>
<p><strong>I already filled an incorrect preference list, what should I do?</strong></p>
<p>Well you can make a fresh &ldquo;changed&rdquo; preference list, but ONLY ONCE. You need to fill up a form</p>
<p>that will be released soon and send with a &ldquo;new&rdquo; application fee. Keep in mind that it should</p>
<p>reach the campus by 5 pm, 30th June.</p>
<p><strong>How should I choose my preference list?</strong></p>
<p>Just choose all the branches you wouldn&rsquo;t mind taking at BITS and add them all to your</p>
<p>preference list. Just make sure to have their order in the exact same order in which you prefer the</p>
<p>branches.</p>
<p>The way the preference systems work, if you put EEE as 2nd choice and Mech as 3rd choice, then</p>
<p>mech wouldn&rsquo;t affect you in any way if you get EEE (because it&rsquo;s a lower choice).</p>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;m confident I will get XYZ at ABC campus. Should I fill in other branches that I don&rsquo;t even</strong></p>
<p><strong>want?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you should. There is no way of knowing for sure how much the cutoffs rise, if they do. Fill in</p>
<p>all the branches that you might be okay with if you want to ensure that you&rsquo;ll at least have a seat.</p>
<p>And keep those at the bottom of your list, in the order of you preferring them. This is just to make</p>
<p>sure that in the unfortunate event of you not getting XYZ at ABC, you will at least still have a</p>
<p>chance at BITS.</p>
<p><strong>My score is almost at last year&rsquo;s cutoff, and I will do everything I can to ensure I get a seat</strong></p>
<p><strong>at BITS. What do I do?</strong></p>
<p>See, in the event of cutoffs rising too much, there is not a lot that can be done. However, you can</p>
<p>cover your bases by filling in all the branches, along with all the Dual Degrees. People usually</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t fill the MSc courses because they don&rsquo;t know exactly what Dual Degrees are. Don&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>that mistake. Fill in the MSc courses too, in the order of you liking them and at a preferable</p>
<p>position in the list.</p>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;m filling in MSc courses in my list along with BE options. Does it mean that it will affect</strong></p>
<p><strong>my BE preferences in any way?</strong></p>
<p>No. It won&rsquo;t. All the options are treated equally, and all that matters is your order of preferring</p>
<p>them. So choose wisely.</p>
<p><strong>Why is the author constantly stressing on filling preferences properly?</strong></p>
<p>Firstly because you have to decide whether you want to spend the next 4 or 5 years in the wrong</p>
<p>branch or instead just understand how the process works and make an informed decision in the</p>
<p>next few days.</p>
<p>And also because the author has had first-hand experience in what happens when you don&rsquo;t fill in</p>
<p>your preferences correctly. The author had no clue about whether he was going to get a seat or</p>
<p>not until the very end. And to live with the information that you don&rsquo;t know where you&rsquo;re going,</p>
<p>or what will happen to you, is a nightmare. And to live with that for one month, is worse.</p>
<p>This obviously won&rsquo;t happen to everyone, but there will be people who may have to struggle</p>
<p>because of not filling their preferences properly. Read about iterations to get a better idea of how</p>
<p>seats are allotted.</p>
