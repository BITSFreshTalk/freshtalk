	<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DISCLAIMER</span></strong> - This FAQ is written by students of BITS Pilani University and is &ldquo;<strong><em>Not Official&rdquo;</em></strong>. This is merely to guide the students and everyone is expected to do their own research before they make any decisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>College Selection</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that you are done with all your exams, the next big question is probably, &lsquo;Where to join?&rsquo; However simple this question may seem, the answer is not that simple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Which college is good, ABC or PQR?</strong></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the right question to ask. What you must understand is that no one person can have a complete picture of two or more colleges or campuses. Therefore, a senior cannot give you a straight answer to a such a question unless you are comparing some Ganga-Bhavani-Gayatri local college with IIT or BITS-Pilani.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Then what is the right question to ask?</strong></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ask seniors to compare their college/campus with another. The best way to exploit them is to ask them about their own college (not about some other college). Collect information about academics, faculty, campus culture, crowd, placements (if it matters) etc. of their college. Every person will have their own yardsticks. Ask yourself what you want from your university and choose the college which suits aptly to your preferences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>But there XYZ senior said &ldquo;ABC is obviously better than DEF&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get swept away by comments like: &lsquo;Obviously ABC college/campus is better.&rsquo; Ask them how and why it is better. You don&rsquo;t want to blame them later for giving you a wrong advice. It&rsquo;s about you and <em>you </em>have to take a final call.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I am actually looking for a college where the placements are very good so that I can get placed easily.</strong></p>
<p>While it is important to consider placements as a parameter, don&rsquo;t get swayed away by the notion that you will be &lsquo;easily&rsquo; placed with that college&rsquo;s tag. Companies recruit <strong><em>you</em></strong>, not the college. The most the college can do for you is get the company for placements, but after that you are on your own. The only difference for the company is that the probability of finding valuable employees is greater in good colleges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Then what is the difference between a good college and a bad college?</strong></p>
<p>Opportunities. Reputed colleges have a proper student and work culture, which means that you can take the help of your peers and teachers for learning opportunities, while faculty will allow you more chances for exposure. On the other hand, most of the same needs to be self-driven when it comes to a below average college. That&rsquo;s the most important difference. (All three BITS campuses are considered good in this regard)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I don&rsquo;t know which branch to choose. What should I do?</strong></p>
<p>For branch selection, refer to: *link to Branch selection FAQ*</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I am not getting the branch of my choice in the college I like. Shall I take another branch (with lower cutoff) in the same college?</strong></p>
<p>This is the trickiest thing about college selection. Do remember that, if you don&rsquo;t like your branch, you won&rsquo;t enjoy your college life. Your branch will stay with you for your life. Taking the branch of your liking is in the best suitable college must be your priority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BITS vs IIT?</strong></p>
<p>Now, before we even talk about this, there are two very simple cases for this scenario. Either its an old IIT or a new one. Let's consider both:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BITS vs Old IITs:</span></p>
<p>Well, congratulations if you have the liberty of choosing between one of the old IITs and BITS, both extremely prestigious in their own rights and having their own benefits. First consider the branches you&rsquo;re getting in both places. If you&rsquo;re getting what you want in one of the old IITs then probably the most tried and tested path is going with the IIT. Pilani CS is often considered to be at par with CS at IIT Bombay. Having said that, the older IITs have a reputation of their own and it would be not right on our part to ignore that and suggest BITS. BITS Pilani is quite flexible in terms of its curriculum and it does adapt to changes in education much faster than the IITs, and the biggest factor is that there is no reservation, only merit. It depends on you how much you value these. However, the decision is yours and the more conventional one is to go with the older IITs, in this case if you&rsquo;re getting a branch of your choice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BITS vs New IITs:</span></p>
<p>Consider the branch you&rsquo;re getting in both the colleges, and first give preference to your desired branch. Assuming you&rsquo;re getting your desired branch in both places, the question just boils down to &lsquo;how much do you value the IIT tag?&rsquo; As a lot of seniors have mentioned, the new IITs have certain problems in terms of them not having enough faculty or being operated out of other campuses. On the other hand, all the three BITS campuses are better established in comparison to these and if you&rsquo;re ready to live without the IIT tag, you may choose BITS without hesitation. There is no reservation and there is a better alumni network for sure. As mentioned earlier, the question is just reduced to how much you value the IIT tag, although BITS does have a tag of its own.</p>
