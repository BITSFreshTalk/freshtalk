<p><strong>How to study for BITSAT 15</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are some tips that you guys might find helpful -</p>
<p>1) Dont worry about any admissions now. Give all the exams and then when you have all the results, thats when you need to study.</p>
<p>2) Do not focus on just BITSAT. There are so many factors that can go wrong in a single exam, so you also need to prepare equally well for JEE as well as BITSAT.</p>
<p>3) Keeping 2 in mind, you should have given as many exams as possible. JEE and BITSAT are a must. Also recommended are state exams + any other private universities you think you need to keep backup in (Yes, VIT too)</p>
<p>4) As for the daily schedule, there is no one-size-fits-all. You need to figure out what you are most comfortable with and how you work best. Some will study for long high-intensity bursts and then take equally long breaks, while others will just study a couple hours at a time. You may choose to study during day or night. You may decide that reading books makes you understand the topic or maybe solving problems does, or possibly understanding it from a teacher/friend. Whatever you do, YOU must be comfortable with it. That way, you are on your peak efficiency. That's what matters more.</p>
<p>5) A couple weeks before BITSAT is the first time you will focus on JEE and BITSAT separately. BITSAT (and Mains, to an extent) requires you to have a decent understanding of the basics of topics, JEE advanced needs you to be specialized in it. There are different levels of depths you need to touch upon for each topic for either exam, and you will have to start to prepare for both. BITSAT has a few extra (pretty high scoring) topics in its syllabus so you will need to understand them too. BITSAT Chemistry is always disastrous for most students, so you need to pay special attention to it and the various topics that figure heavily in BITSAT. Overall, JEE advanced requires you to be "perfect in n topics" while BITSAT requires you to be "bad at 0 topics and be really fast/accurate"</p>
<p>6) Now that you know the basic difference, you can start giving the appropriate focus on BITSAT and JEE. Its a good time to start doing practise papers and figure out where you really stand (Over-estimating yourself can be the worst enemy ever). Practise papers are also brilliant in telling you about your weaknesses, even if you didnt realise they were your weak points. Make sure to ALWAYS do practise papers with SOLUTIONS, not just answer key.</p>
<p>7) While doing papers, you will not know about anything except getting accustomed to doing a 3 hour paper. You still have a lot to learn. Thats why its MORE important to correct your paper than give it. If you are writing a 3 hr paper, there should be atleast 2-3 hours of analysing after it. Check your answers if they're wrong, figure out if you used the correct logic, understand the correct logic, note down which topic/subtopic the question was from, and continue on. By the end of the paper, you would have narrowed down a few topics where you lost marks heavily. Now fill those gaps.</p>
<p>8) I personally recommend spending the rest of the day filling gaps, and giving 1 paper a day. That way you give adequate attention to both being "fast" and knowing everything. Remember, BITSAT expects you to be fast AND make no errors. Make use of the practise papers and get better at both. If you keep doing papers and filing holes rigorously enough, you'll eventually improve. By orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>9) In the last couple weeks, just keep your eyes on all of the above. Maybe you need to explore the nuances of the syllabus and understand some specific topics. Maybe you just arent comfortable with some things. Maybe you need to quick-learn "HIGH-SCORING" topics. Or you just want to chill out. Its completely upto you, you will know where you stand and how you perform.</p>
<p>10) Whatever you do, just keep your head down and remember the essentials. DO NOT OVERWORK YOURSELF OR END UP BURNING OUT. But do not understudy and regret later either. For BITSAT specific, make sure to be decent with EVERY topic, be FAST and not make ERRORS.</p>
<p>ALL THE BEST!</p>
