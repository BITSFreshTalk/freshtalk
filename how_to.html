	<p><strong>HOW TO DECIDE YOUR OPTIONS</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Find out your approx Mains/Advanced rank</p>
<p>2) Find out what are the options (Branch as well as campus) you are getting in BITS, IITs, NITs, IIITs or any other colleges</p>
<p>3) Make a preliminary reading about some relevant facts about BITS and other colleges. Read about dual degrees at BITS and see if it makes sense to you (Only applicable for some cases)</p>

<p>4) Start researching about the branches you are currently getting and find out which ones of them you like the most (For starters read <a href="http://www.joomag.com/magazine/the-fine-print-issue-zero-july-2013/0593752001372776261">this Fine Print Edition</a>). Don&rsquo;t be swayed by cutoffs to take the branch which everyone takes, but look into your own interests</p>
<p>5) Check out more information about the courses. See <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxP7SK74c9ZnTHZMcUlMRk5wcFk/view?usp=sharing">Single Degree Course Chart</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxP7SK74c9ZncXo2cDdsR2xHQkU/view?usp=sharing">Dual Degree Course Chart</a> <em>(please ignore the first page of Dual Degree Course Chart)</em> for the list of courses you will study.</p>
<p>6) Google all the relevant topics related to your course and see if you tend to like them/ are ready to opt for the branch.</p>
<p>7) Contact seniors relevant to your given branch and ask them about the scope of the branch, applications, what will be study, required aptitude and how tough it will be. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w3fYe18A-ADNwdVQCFgx-WExBBWYNrS5QmNFZ7GxqZo/edit?usp=sharing">This spreadsheet</a> gives a list of them</p>
<p>8) Come back to us after you have a decent idea about what branch contains what and which ones you like more. If you think you like all branches equally, repeat steps 4 to 7.</p>
<p>9) Make a list of your personal criteria for a college (Academics, Flexibility, 0% attendance, extra-curricular activities, placements, good research, culture and fests, location, enjoyment, hard work required etc)</p>
<p>10) Start judging all your options and see which ones offer you the greatest benefits to you. Ask seniors "specific" questions based on your personal criteria and start ordering your options up based on their strengths and weaknesses in terms of those criteria</p>
<p>11) Get multiple opinions on those "specific" questions from different seniors and keep in mind any personal biases they would have. In choosing between say IIT and BITS, get opinions of seniors from both colleges. Feel free to ask them details about their campuses.</p>
<p>12) Now that you have a good idea about everything, make up your mind. Place your choice of branch higher over your choice of campus. If placement is a criteria for you, also keep in mind that you may go much higher than average if you like your branch and much lower if you dont</p>
<p>13) Go through your list of criteria and see which universities and branches suit you best. Apply for them.</p>
<p>14) Keep some backup options just in case, and be prepared if there are any surprises later on.</p>
<p>15) If you plan on joining BITS, make sure to fill preference list carefully and well before 30th June. </a></p>
<p>16) Make sure you let us know if you are joining BITS Pilani.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Understand your options and decide well. Your career may be at stake. Good luck </strong></p>
