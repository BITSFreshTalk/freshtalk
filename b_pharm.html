	<p>We thank Asmitha Vanaparthi (Hyderabad Campus) for clarifying many things regarding B.Pharm.</p>

<p><strong>B.Pharm at BITS-Pilani</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BITS-Pilani, Pilani Campus and BITS-Pilani, Hyderabad campus offer the B.Pharm program to students from both PCM and PCB backgrounds. If a candidate wishes to apply for the B.Pharm.program, he/she must apply for it separately irrespective of whether he/she is a PCM or PCB student.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I am a PCM student. Can I take up the B.Pharm. stream?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. PCM students can take B.Pharm. You have to apply separately for the B.Pharm program (i.e. apart from applying for admission to BE and M.Sc. (Hons.) programs).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>But how can I pursue B.Pharm. given that I did not study Biology in the +2?</strong></p>
<p>All that should matter is whether you like the subject or not. They know that you did not study Biology in +2. So, the courses are structured in such a way that you will not have any great difficulty in catching up. Moreover, in the first year, you will be having General Biology as a compulsory course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>My score may not be sufficient for taking admission to either BE or M.Sc. streams. Can I take B.Pharm. and try for a transfer to a BE stream?</strong></p>
<p>No. There is no such provision for B.Pharm students to transfer from B.Pharm. to BE stream. This has been confirmed from the Admission Division of BITS-Pilani.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Is it advisable to take admission to B.Pharm. for BITS tag?</strong></p>
<p>Take B.Pharm. only if you have at least a slight interest in it. You will be struck with a subject which you don&rsquo;t like. So take B.Pharm. if you have at least some aptitude in it and then try for a BE dual or transfer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What are the options for B.Pharm. students if they want to do something not related to branch (like MBA)? Can I take up any BE topics without any transfers or dual?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>BITS-Pilani offers Minor Degree in subjects like Finance (which has good prospects like in Finance sector or for MBA) and Physics (if you are interested).</li>
<li>All single degree students (including BPharm students) can take up 3 or 4 Open Electives. These electives can be of any course of any branch (including CS). And choosing them has no CGPA requirements or other restrictions.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I like Biology. Will I like pursuing B.Pharm.? </strong></p>
<p>Pharmacy not only requires some knowledge of Biology but also some knowledge of Chemistry and some basic Math and Logical skills. B.Pharm. is the study of drug designing, drug development, drug marketing and jurisdiction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What is the placement scenario of B.Pharm.? </strong></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is regarding Hyderabad Campus</span></em>: Core Pharmacy companies don&rsquo;t usually recruit B.Pharm. students. Even if they do, students usually don&rsquo;t accept those offers because of low pay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Then, what are the options available to students who are genuinely interested in Pharmacy?</strong></p>
<p>Students who are genuinely interested in B.Pharm. usually go for further studies (i.e. MS). And after MS, the opportunities in abroad are, we hear, pretty good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Are B.Pharm. students allowed to sit for placements for BE companies?</strong></p>
<p>It varies with companies. Some companies insist on interviewing students belonging to some specific BE branches only. But most companies don&rsquo;t have any restrictions on the branch.</p>
