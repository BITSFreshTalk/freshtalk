	<p><strong>ITERATIONS</strong></p>

<p><strong>What are iterations?</strong></p>
<p>Seats are filled in several rounds of admission, called Iteration. After each iteration, you will</p>
<p>either be allotted a seat or be put in the &ldquo;Waiting List&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>How many iterations are there?</strong></p>
<p>There are three iterations before you have to report to the campus. After reaching the campus,</p>
<p>there is the fourth (and sometimes fifth) iteration.</p>
<p><strong>When are the various iterations?</strong></p>
<p>See http://www.bitsadmission.com/fd/Impdates_2015.pdf?id=5272015</p>
<p><strong>How are the seats allotted?</strong></p>
<p>The algorithm goes through the list of students in decreasing order of their marks. It then allots</p>
<p>you your highest preference discipline that is not already full.</p>
<p><strong>What if two students have the same marks?</strong></p>
<p>Priority is given to marks in Maths, Physics and then Chemistry (in that order).</p>
<p><strong>If I do not give CSE as a preference, does it give me more chance to get EEE?</strong></p>
<p>No. As long as you clear the respective cutoffs, you will be allotted your highest ranked choice.</p>
<p><strong>I already filled my preference list. Can I change it now?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. See the &ldquo;General&rdquo; questions, there will be a link of the site soon.</p>
<p><strong>Should I apply for ____ discipline even if I don&rsquo;t clear the last year cutoffs?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! If you want to get that degree, you should apply for it. You never know how the cutoffs</p>
<p>change. But make sure the preference list is IN ORDER of your choice for the disciplines.</p>
<p><strong>If I don&rsquo;t want a discipline higher up my preference list, what can I do?</strong></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t opt for it in the first place. Once the iterations start, there is nothing you can do to &ldquo;not get&rdquo;</p>
<p>a seat you do not want. If the available seat is higher on your preference list, you will be slided up,</p>
<p>even if you dont want to. Except in case of Campus Locking. So choose your preference list and</p>
<p>the order wisely.</p>
<p><strong>What is Campus Locking?</strong></p>
<p>A choice given during Admissions to ignore any sliding up to other campuses in 4th and 5th</p>
<p>iterations. If not locked, you may get a higher preference in the other two campuses in the next</p>
<p>iteration.</p>
<p><strong>If I have locked my campus, can I still be slided up?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, to your higher preferences in the same campus.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a fixed amount that I have to pay after I get a seat in any of the iterations?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, there is a specific amount. For more details, see this . It has an account of what you need to</p>
<p>pay after the first iteration, but the idea is the same for other iterations.</p>
<p><strong>Which iteration should I get my branch?</strong></p>
<p>Well the cutoffs for each branch decreases mostly during 2nd iteration and 4th. So chances are</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get in 2nd iteration only. 4th iteration cutoffs decrease by much less and are</p>
<p>pretty unpredictable though. The whole process depends on a lot of factors like counselling for</p>
<p>other colleges, the average performance, difficulty of papers, and a lot more things, which cannot</p>
<p>be spoken for generally and there is no way to know for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Can I change my preferences even after the iterations start?</strong></p>
<p>No. The last date for applying with your Preference Order is 30th June. The first iteration is on 1</p>
<p>July.</p>
<p><strong>Is it possible for me to go back to a lower preference after being allotted a preference high</strong></p>
<p><strong>up on my list?</strong></p>
<p>No, this was why it was important to fill them exactly in the order you wanted them. There is</p>
<p>simply nothing more that can be done at this stage.</p>
