	<p><b>OPINIONS</b></p>
<p><strong><em>Disclaimer</em></strong><em> - These questions are answered to the best of our knowledge but are opinions. Please take them accordingly.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I have got xyz marks. Which branch/campus I should take?</strong></p>
<p>Please note that none of us has any idea about how the cut-offs will vary. We can&rsquo;t tell what branch you may get. But please bear in mind that your choice must be based on your interests and not on what we say. Coming to which campus, all the campuses are par academically. Branch should be given a higher preference over selecting either of Pilani/Goa/Hyderabad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Is BITS better than _______ college?</strong></p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t ask these questions now. Take all of your exams first, and get all the options. After that you will have plenty of time to judge your college and branch</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How is ________ branch in BITS? Is ________ campus better than ________ campus?</strong></p>
<p>Every campus has its own pros and cons, which you cannot judge by simply saying ranking colleges. You will have to judge based on what suits <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span></em> best. Also, see the previous question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Should I apply for _______ college/ give _______ test?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Even if you are 100% confident you will get a better option from another test, you must always give all possible tests, so you have sufficient back up even if things go wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Where should I study from?</strong></p>
<p>Pick any one of the suggested books but try to complete all the relevant portions and exercises. It makes no sense if you leave your book midway while solving. Following one book thoroughly is better than following 10 books randomly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What are the important topics I should focus on?</strong></p>
<p>All of them. BITSAT is random, so you can get questions from any topic. There is NO <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">important topic</span></em>. For good chances to qualify, you don&rsquo;t have to be perfect in any topics, but you do have to be decent in all the topics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How hard are the questions? What should I focus on while writing the exam?</strong></p>
<p>The questions are not very hard and mostly are trivial, probably JEE mains level. But there are a lot of questions and they are time consuming. You should definitely focus on being fast AND accurate, because even one question can make a lot of difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So, how do I prepare for BITSAT? Should I practice?</strong></p>
<p>You must be preparing for JEE Mains and advanced mostly. In addition to this you may also be preparing for VIT, Manipal and other colleges&rsquo; entrances. If BITSAT is the only exam that you&rsquo;re giving, then you need to read the FAQ carefully, you didn&rsquo;t pay attention to the previous answers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re preparing for all the exams mentioned above, it is understood that one of the objectives of doing that is getting your basic concepts in PCM right. Once you do that, you are prepared for BITSAT. Now the number of topics in the syllabus may differ, but the basic idea remains the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Practice is IMPORTANT</span></em>. You can never judge your abilities on a topic or subject without solving questions. You may get lucky sometimes, but without constant practice you cannot be sure of getting a good number of questions correct. So keep practicing sample papers at regular intervals and keep tracking your progress. But only start solving these papers, when you get hold of your basics. Then you can work on improving them!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Should I prepare for English/Logic? If yes, how?</strong></p>
<p>Mostly, targeted preparation for English and logical reasoning is not really required, but do work on it if you feel it&rsquo;s needed. However, PCM should definitely be your focus during the preparation. English and Logical Reasoning can be improved even when you practice the sample papers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How difficult is the actual BITSAT compared to practice papers that are available?</strong></p>
<p>Assuming that the practice papers are from the usually suggested sources, they&rsquo;re not that different from the actual exam. Usually the students find their own year&rsquo;s exam difficult, predominantly because of attempting the practice papers in the comfort of their home and not the actual centre. The pressure to perform is an added factor. However in terms of the speed and accuracy, the practice papers come the closest to giving you a real idea of your preparation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Should I answer the extra questions?</strong></p>
<p>Well, that completely depends on your speed during the exam. Please do not decide before the exam whether you want to attempt the extra questions or not. If you have a good speed of solving and are able to solve about 135/150 questions with around 20 minutes remaining, you can try your chances on the bonus questions. Just remember that the bonus questions also have the same marking scheme. So, it is upto you to decide to take the risk of guessing those 15 remaining questions and going for the bonus or still try solving the 15 questions.</p>
